# Software Engineering Project
- This project was developed as a semester thesis within the subject Software Engineering. 
- The aim was to design and implement a software system according to the given requirements, with emphasis on the correct use of the principles of software development, analysis and system design.

## Topic
**Dining room**
The system should be used for ordering and serving meals (breakfast/lunch/dinner). You can also supply electronic readers with NFC technology to your system. This allows cashless payments via employee cards, but also via mobile phones with an NFC module (an alternative to an employee card). Of course, it is also possible to pay in cash, by credit card and meal vouchers at the dining rooms. In the case of payment via employee card/NFC, the entitlement to a contribution from the employer can be automatically calculated, because your system can be connected to any payroll system. The system contains several modules, e.g. the so-called meal exchange, where a meal can be re-marked as free and someone can order it. It is possible to "overwrite" it specifically to your colleague (if the colleague accepts it in the system). Recharging credit is possible in several ways: directly through the cafeteria's ordering system (like an e-shop with cashless payment), through payroll deductions at the end of the month (thanks to the connection to the payroll system), or in cash directly at the cafeteria's distribution points.

## Submission Criteria
### Document Format
- normal spacing (1.0), font Times New Roman, size 12, margin 2,5 cm
- create commercially successful and unique name

### Four Main Parts Of Project
 #### 1. User Specification
- Brief introduction to the issue: Description of the area, rules, goals, procedures and business logic. Extension of the assignment with missing connections using your own analysis, external sources and discussions.
- User requirements: Defining customer goals, translating them into measurable requirements. Identification and description of functional, non-functional and domain

#### 2. System Specification
- **Use-Case Diagrams** : Draw one or more use-case diagrams representing the software system. The diagram(s) should cover the system's core functionality, ensuring each use case provides valuable functionality, a useful outcome, or an observable change for the user(s).
- **Use-Case Tables**: Create a use-case table for the three most complex use cases, including:
	-   **Use case name**
	-   **Identifier** (custom numbering linking to the use-case diagram)
	-   **Brief description**
	-   **Actors**
	-   **Preconditions**
	-   **Initialization**
	-   **Main event sequence**
	-   **Alternative event sequence**
	-   **Postconditions**
- **Class Diagram**: Develop a detailed data model for the entire system, including all attributes, relationships, multiplicities, and at least some methods. Present it as a single UML 2.x class diagram in the final documentation. If the system is too complex, break it into multiple smaller diagrams for relevant subsystems. Exclude controller classes that are not essential for modeling data entities.
- **Activity and Sequence Diagrams**: Create graphical diagrams for selected non-trivial use cases:
	-  **2 sequence diagrams**
	-  **2 activity diagrams** (which may correspond to multiple use cases)
	-   Activity and sequence diagrams do not have to represent the same scenarios.
- **State Diagram**: Draw a state diagram for the developed system. If necessary, multiple smaller state diagrams can be created instead of one large diagram.
 
 #### 3.  Acceptance tests
 Create tests to determine whether the developed system meets the requirements—i.e., whether the customer accepts it or not. Each test should be documented in a table with at least the following sections:

-   **Identifier**
-   **Use case** the test corresponds to
-   **Test objective** (what is being verified – briefly)
-   **Preconditions**
-   **Postconditions**
-   **Test steps**

The test steps represent the sequence of testing, where each step includes a specific **action** (user input) and the **system's reaction** to it. The system must pass all tests to be accepted by the customer. Since this assignment focuses on system design rather than implementation, the expected system responses must be defined hypothetically.

Include at least **four acceptance tests** in the documentation:

-   Three related to **functional requirements**
-   One related to **non-functional requirements**
 
#### 4.  Project Planning
Create a development (implementation) plan for your system.

1.  **Task Breakdown**: Define at least **10 tasks** and assign them to at least **4 team members**. The number of tasks should reflect the complexity of the project.
2.  **Time Estimation**: Estimate the duration of each task and schedule them in a timeline.
3.  **Gantt Chart & Task Dependencies** (Chapter 4.1): Include a Gantt chart with task dependencies, execution sequence, milestones, and a **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**.
4.  **Network Diagram** (Chapter 4.2): Present a network diagram showing task execution order.


### Change Tracking

At the beginning of the document, **before the table of contents**, include a table logging the dates and descriptions of changes made. This should clearly indicate when modifications were made and what was updated.
